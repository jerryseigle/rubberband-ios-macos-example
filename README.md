# Rubber Band Library â€“ iOS & macOS AVFoundation Example

This project demonstrates how to integrate the [Rubber Band Library](https://breakfastquay.com/rubberband/) into an iOS or macOS application using **AVFoundation**. It includes a working Objective-C example that loads an audio file, applies real-time pitch and time-stretching using Rubber Band, and plays back the processed audio.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- âœ… Real-time audio pitch shifting
- âœ… Optional time-stretching
- âœ… Uses **Rubber Band v4.0.0** (R3 engine support)
- âœ… Formant preservation for natural voice quality
- âœ… Built with **AVAudioEngine** and **AVAudioPlayerNode**

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts

- Rubber Band requires audio to be **de-interleaved** per channel
- Audio is processed in blocks and output is reassembled into buffers
- The `R3` engine (`OptionEngineFiner`) provides higher-quality pitch shifting
- `OptionFormantPreserved` maintains vocal character
